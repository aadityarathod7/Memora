## Interview Talking Points

**When they ask "Tell me about this project":**

"Memora is a full-stack AI-powered journaling application I built using the MERN stack. The unique value proposition is that it doesn't just store entries—it engages users in meaningful conversations through OpenAI's GPT-4 integration.

On the technical side, I architected the entire system from scratch, including a RESTful API with 25+ endpoints, JWT authentication, and a MongoDB database optimized for complex queries. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring responsive design that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.

One challenge I solved was making the mood analytics feel intuitive—I created a GitHub-style heatmap that visualizes 365 days of emotional patterns at a glance. I also implemented offline functionality using IndexedDB, so users can journal even without internet.

Performance was crucial, so I optimized MongoDB queries with aggregation pipelines and indexing, reducing API response times from 800ms to 120ms—an 85% improvement. I also implemented code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size by 40%.

The project showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs, handle real-time features like voice transcription and geolocation, and build production-ready applications with proper authentication, error handling, and user experience considerations."
